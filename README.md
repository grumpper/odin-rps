# The Odin Project | Rock Paper Scissors

The idea is to practise JS by writing a
"Rock Paper Scissors" functionality usable via console.

The original task is described
[here](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors).

The extra features in the implementation is that in addition to JS console,
the outputs are also logged in the browser via `alert()` calls to track
what is happening in an easier and friendlier fashion.
